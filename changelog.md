Changelog

Biggest change is the introduction of hamburger menu functionality: now the icon will open up a menu that lists all the sections of the page. Clicking on any of these listed sections will jump the user to that section. As it should, this hamburger menu only shows up on tablet/phone-sized screens.

Another big change was the introduction of 3rd party JavaScript, specifically in the form of a Google Analytics tag in the head. This was added because it'll give me more insight into how popular the site is, what parts of the site are the most 'active', when traffic arrives, etc. Having this information would perhaps allow me to see which parts of my site get the most attention, meaning I know which parts I should be paying the most attention to getting right.

I also added rounded corners to the images to make them look a little more appealing. In addition, I also fixed a margin error that was present on desktop where the project images would be directly next to their text descriptions: this has been remedied now.

Finally, I removed the last remnants of HW1 where I introduced trivial styling elements in order to use all the elements, e.g. using span styling on the word 'Muir' in the Awards section has now been removed.
